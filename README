About the motifs and kernels:
=============================

In the current release (version X), we include X "kernels" that span 
eight different "computational motifs".  

Kernels are problem definitions, and we provide a reference implementation
(one particular solution) for each kernel. The kernels are organized by the
primary motif they belong to, and so there are eight motif directories.

The reference implementations are either in C or MATLAB (in some cases, 
both). All MATLAB routines corresponding to kernels for a motif are under  
sub-directories named MATLAB.

Building the C implementations:
===============================

1. Set the C compiler and flags in Makefile.in.

2. Execute "make" in the top directory to build all the kernel
implementations. Alternately, execute a make in any sub-directory
to build the kernel implementations corresponding to that motif.

Execution:
==========

See the README files in each sub-directory for instructions on 
problem generation, kernel execution, and verification.

Just executing the kernel without any command-line arguments 
prints out usage details.
