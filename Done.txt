General:
- Add timers throughout. 
- Remove other random number generators and substitute BCNRand throughout C version.
- Update build and run tools 
- Cite HotPar paper and other paper in tech report
- update table in code to better match rest of document, check document throughout
- Cite bcnRand in tech report  


Dense Linear Algebra:
- Write rigorous generator for LU factorization in C and Matlab. 
- Look at "SymmetricQRStep" in both versions for possible bug / extraneous calculation
	with sub-sub-diagonal. 
  Problem is noted in C code, but doesn't seem to be breaking code. 




Monte Carlo: 

- fix comments C.
- Check for memory leaks in qMCIntegrate
- Clean up matlab and add comments. Check that scaling works as desired. 


N Body: 
  C: 
- Redo organization and add comments and makefile. 
- Add comparisons to naive / verification for all cases. 
  Matlab: 
- Organization, verification and comments. 


Sort: 
- Update generators, add more rigorous description of



Sparse Linear Algebra:
- update matlab GMRES to properly handle preconditioners 
- consider non-symmetric generator for GMRES
- C matrix powers
- Add a laplacian computation for verification of spmv
- matlab SpMV verification
- update C checks with an "all passed" 
- clean up I/O
- remove poor quality of check matrix powers in matlab 

Spectral Methods:
- Comments for C
- Check table usage for C->R fft, new exponential factors being set in loop. 
- remove remnants of NAS pde solver in matlab version
	also kill: generate data
		rmsErr2d
		time3FFTs
		naiveDFT
		2d fft
		checkCTfft
- Update check scripts in Matlab. Add a third script to include ct, stock, 4step
- Fix spelling of Cooley Tukey in matlab and fix CVS
- Comments Matlab 


Structured Grid:
- Consider using matrix powers for explicit vector heat equation solve
- More broad / rigorous dataset generators for differential operators
- Add new differential ops to Matlab version. 
- Update makefile to build spectral and spLA kernels if not already built. 
- Update comments for consistency considering new typing system
