General:

- Command line control?   
	- Usage guides at command line / print usage when C code is run. 

- List where tested etc



Dense Linear Algebra:

- Consider data structure update for tridiagonal matrices in QR. 

- Update LU verification to solve system and calculate residual. 



Monte Carlo: 





N Body: 

- check values for cutoff, in force dimension depends on L2 dist to nearest, in cutoff on x component only


Sort: 

- Consider separating into headers / generators etc. 



Sparse Linear Algebra:

- Consider C GMRES
     


Spectral Methods:

- Consider expanding complex arithmetic routines' comments. 



Structured Grid:

- Consider adding more mathematically rigorous checks of convergence rates 
	and norm calculators for PDE solvers. 

- Scrambling / permuting of input data for heat equations with explicit methods
